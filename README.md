## Why I chose Tone.js 
I've been taken interest in making music and sounds in general through programming. I've been doing something similar in another class, using a midi controller(that is system installed to connect the keys to the program.) I want to something similar to that since I'm a little familar with that but this seems like it's going to be a bit  challenging for me since I'm still pretty new to coding. But tone.js seems to have a large variety of functions and methods to play around with.

## Errors, Warnings, and Mistakes
AudioContext

I've been getting some warnings about the AudioContext, saying it's not allowed to start. These errors are located in the tone.min.js file and I'm not sure what I should do. this is to prevent autoplay, though I'm trying to use a button to play the tune.

Playing Audio with Poly Synth on Sync 
When I press play, it plays the tune but when I press the button again, it glitches out a bit and doesn't play until you refresh.
