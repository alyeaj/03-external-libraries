## Why I chose Tone.js 
I've been taken interest in making music and sounds in general through programming. I've been doing something similar in another class, using a midi controller(that is system installed to connect the keys to the program.) I want to something similar to that since I'm a little familar with that but this seems like it's going to be a bit  challenging for me since I'm still pretty new to coding. But tone.js seems to have a large variety of functions and methods to play around with.

## Errors, Warnings, and Mistakes
AudioContext

I've been getting some warnings about the AudioContext, saying it's not allowed to start. These errors are located in the tone.min.js file and I'm not sure what I should do. this is to prevent autoplay, though I'm trying to use a button to play the tune.

Playing Audio with Poly Synth on Sync 

When I press play, it plays the tune but when I press the button again, it glitches out a bit and doesn't play until you refresh. Maybe that's how it's susposed to be but it was able to play multiple times when I was doing just synth with one note playing. 



## How It Works & Issues
You press buttons, and you get a sound. The screen will show you the keys and the notes of each tune. But you can only play it once and have to refresh to play the sound again or play a different sound. After you press one button, you'll have to refresh if you want to play the next one with audio. The keys and notes will show though. 


## Process 
My partner and I decided to work on 2 methods each separately since that what worked best for our schedules. We would then combine our methods into one of our repositories to be submitted. We had a similar idea in using buttons to generate sound.
